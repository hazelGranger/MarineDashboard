## Marine Dashboard
I classified the data to 4 types:

Sea Surface Wave(maximum_height, significant_height, direction)

Surface Sea Water Speed

Wind (Speed at 10m above ground level, direction)

Air Temperature at 2m above ground level

Among them, the direction uses arrows' direction to display,
others are just shown by LineChart

The work hasn't quite finished, csv and json data is just merged but not sorted!
LineChart data does not filter the data without no value in the particular dimension.
